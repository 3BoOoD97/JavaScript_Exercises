# Picture In Picture

PiP is a special type of multi-window mode that used for video playback. 
It lets the user watch a video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

**NOTE**
to avoid bugs it is recommended to update your Chrome or Firefox browser to the latest version + I have not tried the program using another browser.
